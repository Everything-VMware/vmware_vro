//A short Powershell script I wrote to demonstrate how to open vCloud Director VM console in the (Windows) Standalone VM Console.

$vm = get-CIVM 'CentOS7'
$vmrcPath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Remote Console\vmrc.exe"
$mks = $vm.ExtensionData.AcquireMksTicket()
$thumbprint = $mks.Ticket.Substring($mks.Ticket.get_Length()-61,59)
$parameter = "vmrc://$($mks.Host)/?thumbprint=$($thumbprint)&path=$($mks.Vmx)&websocket=wss://$($mks.Host)/($mks.Port);$($mks.Ticket)" & "$vmrcPath" $parameter

//The script should be pretty self explanatory. You need to have PowerCLI for vCloud Director installed and be logged in (as tenant or system admin).
//$vm variable contains the VM for which you want to open the console. $vrmcPath is the path to the locally installed VMware Remote Console application. Next you need to acquire VMâ€™s MKS ticket and with little manipulation send it to the application as a parameter.
