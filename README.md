vRO Sample Codes are not so easily available.
The main purpose of this repository is to provide vRO related code snippets which can make the vRO development a bit simpler.
I have written or manipulated code multiple times for vRO, vSphere, vCloud etc, which I am very glad to share.
SHARING IS CARING
