vRO Sample Codes are not so easily available.
The main purpose of this repository is to provide vRO related code snippets which can make the vRO development a bit simpler.
Being a vRO developer since 4 years, I have written or manipulated code multiple times for vRO, vSphere, vCloud etc, which I am very glad to share.

This doesnt contain long easy codes but some tricky things we can do with vRO or some complex codes.
